# üéØ Stripe Setup Guide for Elixiary AI

This guide will walk you through setting up Stripe payments for your app in **under 15 minutes**.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- Stripe account (free): https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
- Access to your Vercel project
- Terminal access to run scripts

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe API Keys

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`)
3. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)

---

### Step 2: Create Products & Prices (Automated)

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
# Install tsx if you don't have it
npm install -g tsx

# Set your Stripe secret key
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here

# Run the setup script
npx tsx scripts/setup-stripe.ts
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Create "Elixiary AI Pro" product
- ‚úÖ Create 4 price points (early bird + regular, monthly + annual)
- ‚úÖ Output all Price IDs you need
- ‚úÖ Save configuration to `stripe-config.json`

**Expected Output:**
```
‚ú® Stripe setup complete! Here are your Price IDs:

STRIPE_EARLY_BIRD_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_abc123
STRIPE_EARLY_BIRD_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_def456
STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_ghi789
STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_jkl012
```

---

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables

2. Add these variables (use values from Step 2):

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (from Step 1)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (from Step 1)
STRIPE_EARLY_BIRD_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_... (from script output)
STRIPE_EARLY_BIRD_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_... (from script output)
STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_... (from script output)
STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_... (from script output)
```

3. **Important:** Set these for **Production** environment

---

## üîó Step 4: Set Up Webhook

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your app about payment events.

### 4.1: Create Webhook Endpoint

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. Enter your webhook URL:
   ```
   https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook
   ```
   Replace `your-domain` with your actual Vercel domain (e.g., `ai.elixiary.com`)

### 4.2: Select Events

Select these 5 events:
- ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.updated`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.deleted`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_failed`

### 4.3: Get Signing Secret

1. After creating the endpoint, click on it
2. Click **"Reveal"** next to "Signing secret"
3. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
4. Add it to Vercel:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

---

## üß™ Step 5: Test Your Setup

### 5.1: Redeploy on Vercel

After adding all environment variables, trigger a redeploy:
- Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
- Click on latest deployment ‚Üí "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"

### 5.2: Test Checkout Flow

1. Go to your deployed app
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro" or visit `/pricing`
3. Click on Monthly or Annual plan
4. Use Stripe test card:
   ```
   Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry: Any future date
   CVC: Any 3 digits
   ZIP: Any 5 digits
   ```
5. Complete checkout
6. Verify you're upgraded to Pro in `/account`

### 5.3: Verify Webhook

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Check "Attempts" tab - should show successful events

## üìä What Each Price ID Does

| Variable | Purpose | Price | Duration |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| `STRIPE_EARLY_BIRD_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` | First 50 users monthly | $1.49/mo | 3 months ‚Üí $4.99 |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY not configured"
**Solution:** Make sure you added the env var to Vercel and redeployed

### Issue: Webhook returns 400 error
**Solution:** Check that `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly in Vercel

### Issue: Checkout button doesn't work
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set

### Issue: Payment succeeds but user not upgraded
**Solution:** Check webhook logs in Stripe dashboard. Verify webhook events are enabled

### Issue: "Invalid price ID"
**Solution:** Double-check the Price IDs in Vercel match the ones from the script output

## üéì Understanding Stripe Events

| Event | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | User completes payment ‚Üí Upgrade to Pro |

## üîê Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to Git
- ‚úÖ Use test mode (`sk_test_`, `pk_test_`) until ready
- ‚úÖ Webhook secret verifies requests are from Stripe
- ‚úÖ Metadata links Stripe customers to Firebase users
