## ðŸš§ Pending Feature (1/4)

### 4. AI-Generated Cocktail Images ðŸš§
**Status**: Planned for Future Release

**Reason for Deferral**:
- Gemini Imagen 3 requires Vertex AI setup
- Additional cost per image generation (~$0.04-0.08)
- Complexity of integration vs current free-tier focus
- Requires GCP billing setup

**Planned Implementation**:
- Use Gemini Imagen 3 via Vertex AI
- Generate cocktail images based on recipe
- Store image URLs in Firestore
- Display in recipe cards
- Pro-only feature with optional limits (e.g., 100/month)

**Alternative Approaches**:
1. Wait for Gemini 2.0 Flash multimodal improvements
2. Use Gemini to generate detailed image prompts + external API
3. Partner with Unsplash/Pexels for stock cocktail images
4. User-uploaded images

**When to Implement**:
- After achieving profitability to cover API costs
- When Gemini Imagen becomes available in free tier
- When Pro user base justifies the feature investment

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**Current State**: 75% of planned Pro features are complete and production-ready.

**For Launch**:
- âœ… Proceed with current 3 Pro features
- âœ… Market as "unlimited recipes + advanced features"
- âœ… Add image generation as "Coming Soon" to pricing page
- âœ… Collect user feedback on feature priority

**Post-Launch**:
- Monitor which features drive conversions
- Survey Pro users about desired features
- Implement image generation based on demand
- Consider other high-value features:
  - Recipe history & analytics
  - Ingredient inventory tracking
  - Social sharing & community features
  - Recipe collections & meal planning

## ðŸ’¡ Value Proposition (Without Images)

**Current Pro offering is strong**:
1. **Unlimited generations** - Core value prop
2. **Unlimited saves** - Core value prop
3. **PDF export** - Practical, shareable
4. **Advanced customization** - Power user feature
5. **Customer portal** - Self-service convenience

**This is sufficient for launch** because:
- Main pain point is the 10/month limit on free tier
- Pro users value quantity over extra features
- 3 bonus features justify the price
- Can add images later based on feedback
