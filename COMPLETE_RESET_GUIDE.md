## üéØ Step-by-Step Reset Process

### Step 1: Cancel All Stripe Subscriptions (2 minutes)

2. **For each subscription**:
   - Click the checkbox next to each subscription
   - Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Cancel subscriptions"
   - Choose "Cancel immediately"
   - Confirm

**OR** do it one by one:

2. **Find your subscriptions** (filter by email: opefyre@gmail.com)
3. **For each subscription**:
   - Click on it
   - Click "Cancel subscription" (top right)

   - Confirm

## üßπ Automated Cleanup Script (Advanced)

If you want to automate this, I can create a script, but manual cleanup via dashboards is safer for now.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After cleanup, verify:

- [ ] No active subscriptions in Stripe
- [ ] Customer deleted in Stripe (or has no subscriptions)
